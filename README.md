# bus-display
Bad C++ console app to display data about a bus on a pixel display.  
Inspired by display systems of Israeli buses.

## Installation
just run `make` lmao

## Customization
Currently, there are no means of customization. You'll have to modify `src\main.cpp` to display certain numbers.  
After finishing the drawing code for the different displays, I'll start working on customization methods.

## Credit me!
If you decide to use my code for your project, or if you're a bus company in need of a display system (and you want to use my project for some reason, which would be a bad idea), please credit me!

## DISCLAIMER
Using my code for anything serious is actually a shit idea (as I said above)... please don't do this.
