# bus-display
Bad C++ console app to display data about a bus on a pixel display.  
Inspired by display systems of Israeli buses.

## Installation
just run `make` lmao

## Customization
Currently, there are no means of customization. You'll have to modify `src\main.cpp` to display certain numbers.  
After finishing the drawing code for the different displays, I'll start working on customization methods.
